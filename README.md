Description: Deep learning Library

Details    : Bricks of deep learning will be implemented in this library as atomic programs. \
			 Programs will be mainly implemented in Python by using Anaconda - Jupyter Notebook for the sake of constructing live source codes with embedded discussions.
			 Pure source codes with .py extension can be created from within Jupyter Notebook.
